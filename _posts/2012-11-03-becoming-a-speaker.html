  <h2>On Motivation - Becoming a Speaker</h2>
  <p>About two months ago I annouced that I'd be speaking at a conference for the very first time. A friend reached out and asked me a pretty important question. "Why speak at all?" He was curious about the motivation to speak and why it's so common for programmers (not me) and designers (yes, me) to take up speaking.</p>

  <p>I thought it might make for a semi-interesting blog post.</p>

  <p>But, my answer's a pretty selfish one. The reason I started and now have continued to speak at conferences is pretty simple actually: I want to be a good speaker. Maybe even a great one, someday. And I figure that if I start now, and become acquainted with the almost-certain vomit-inducing/crippling nervousness that is the art of speaking, then maybe I'll have a chance at becoming one.</p>

  <p>After forcing myself to rewatch them I've noticed that I've improved with every speaking opportunity. After my most recent talk, I even felt like I had arrived at the ability to communicate actual thoughts while on stage, rather than just parroting what's on my slides. Now that I've spoken a few times I've arrived at a much more important reason that I think will keep me speaking.</p>

  <p> If anything I say will help someone who's listening (or their team) a. move faster, b. work happier, or c. have a better fucking day, then it's completely worth my time. Every second of it, actually.</p>

  <p>There are a few things that have made my speaking experiences really good and also a few that have made them a lot harder. Here's a few of them to be aware of before you decide to speak or conversely, abandon it completely:</p>

  <p><strong>1. Conference size.</strong> This may be trivial to some people, but for me, speaking at a smaller, tighter-knit, conference was 10x better than the experience of speaking at a massive 10-track conference. And it's not just about filling a room. People at smaller conferences are a lot less likely to be dicks. And the conference organizers do a much better job of facilitating a safe, respectful environment for both the speakers and attendees.</p>
    
  <p>JSCONFEU really set the bar as far as creating an environment I will continue to want to be a part of and contribute to. They even wrote up a <a href="http://2012.jsconf.eu/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> to lay down some ground rules. Every conference should consider doing this. In fact, I'll probably think twice before I speak at another conference who's organizers don't write and enforce one.</p>

  <p><strong>2. Conference talks are a lot of work.</strong> A LOT. Every speaker I've ever spoken to has admitted this. And I was still surprised to find out that it's true. I even felt like my slides were pretty simple and I still ended up spending no less than 40 hours of work on each talk.</p>

  <p><strong>3. Inevitably, not everyone will love you or what you have to say.</strong> Or maybe they will. But it's better to be prepared for worst, I guess. I was recently trolled pretty hard by an attendee who literally called me annoying and then later a 'sisgrammer' on twitter before I had even opened my mouth to speak. Some people just decide to dislike you, and find arbitrary things, in this case my 'foul mouth', to try to discredit you. Best piece of advice? Ignore them. Those people probably don't deserve your consideration. Additionally, you're not forcing them to listen to you. If they don't like what they're hearing they can leave. In fact, it's probably better that they do because it frees up room for people who <i>do</i> want to hear what you have to say and/or might benefit from it.</p>

  <p><strong>4. Absolutely be yourself.</strong> I was incredibly nervous to speak, both as a newbie and being incredibly yawkard (young and awkward). The only little kernel of hope that I had to hold onto was that I'm pretty proud of the person I am and what I've accomplished and/or built in my time as a designer/developer. Take those things on stage with you and you'll be fine.</p>

  <p><strong>5. Speaking is probably more rewarding than any of us deserve.</strong> After my second talk I got an email that literally just said "Thank you for giving this talk." How fucking awesome is it to feel like you've maybe made someone else's life or maybe even just the way they work a tiny bit better? It's pretty awesome.</p>

  <p>My talks have finally surfaced on the Internet. And I've made a home for them on my blog. Here's a link to my talk <a href="/2012-11-03-because-fuck-photoshop.html">Because F%$k Photoshop</a>.</p>
