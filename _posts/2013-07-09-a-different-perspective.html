  <p>I didn't grow up believing I could do anything I wanted to.</p>

  <p>I grew up in a community where it isn't that common for young people to continue their education past high school. Most of the people I grew up with ended up with jobs that pay just above minimum wage and that have very little room for growth or promotion. Most people where I come from do not believe they have the ability to change their circumstances and they very rarely move up in socio-economic class.</p>

  <p>Growing up, I was discouraged from pursuing a career that required a college education. I knew that I wanted to do something different than what I saw around me. I knew I wanted to go to college, but I never thought much past those four years because of how unlikely it seemed that I would make it there. I didn't know a single computer scientist. I didn't know that 'web developer' or 'software designer' were careers. The only things that seemed within my reach were the jobs either my parents or my friend's parents worked.</p>

  <p>I stumpled upon my first job at a tech company by total accident. And while all of the developers who worked there encouraged me to learn how to program and design, it wasn't until I saw a woman succeed in that enviroment that I thought it was also possible for me.</p>

  <p>I now consider myself somewhat successful. I'm designer and a developer at a company I love and one that is well-respected by my peers. The work I do doesn't feel like work. My yearly salary is almost 3x what my mother made when she retired after 35 years of work. And I get to do things I never thought I'd have the opportunity to. I get to travel, I set my own work schedule, and most importantly, I really do believe that I have the opportunity to effect change. Sometimes, if I'm really lucky, I get to inspire other people to do the same.</p>

  <p>My experiences thus far have lead me to want to make it easier for people like me to succeed in this industry. So along with designing and building web applications, I've created some things that a younger, less experienced me would have benefited from at the start of my career. These things do not exclude men from participating. Instead, they are aimed at strengthening the community around and surfacing the work of women who are respected by women and men alike.</p>

  <p>Landing a job in tech has not been the biggest challenge in my career. And every time I talk about what lead me to create <a href="http://passion-projects.github.com/">Passion Projects</a>, I am forced to talk about my negative experiences in the tech industry. A coworker and friend recently brought it to my attention that if I hadn't experienced those things, I wouldn't be motivated or have the experience to attempt to fix the things that caused me to have those bad experiences in the first place. Whether or not my efforts have had a positive net impact on the community, I can't be entirely sure. But my friend's words made me feel like I was moving in the right direction.</p>

  <p>The best way to make sure your experience doesn't go to waste is to invest it in other people. I believe most Women in Tech initiatives are reinvesting the collective experience of other women in our industry and building communities and support systems around that shared experience.</p>

  <p>If you've succeeded without support systems like these, that's great. You have every right to be proud of yourself. Keep doing what you're doing, because it's working for you. But when did it become any of our job's to decide what can and does work for other women? It seems kind of low to attempt to discredit or attack the communities and support systems of other women purely because they are not directly benefiting us. And unfortunately in doing so, we discourage people, specifically marginalized people, from reaching out for the support and resources they may actually want or need.</p>

  <p>Yes, there are problems. Some of these were addressed in <a href="http://pensieve.verou.me/post/54853162595/on-women-in-tech">a recent blog post</a> and while I had a hard time agreeing with the author's conclusions about the impact of the Women in Tech movement, I found a few specific arguments to be valid:
    <ul>
      <li>I, too, am deeply bothered by the idea that women should be hired into roles they aren't qualified for diversity's sake. It's a problem that I've been vocal about in hiring conversations and my concern has been met with respect and consideration by most. No one wants to be hired to be a token anything. Nor does anyone want to be hired to fill a quota. If they do, they're probably there for the wrong reasons.</li>
      <br>
      <li>As a woman, and someone from a mixed background, I am also often offended by people who use political, racial, or gender equality issues as a platform to promote themselves or to define their personal brand.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p><strong>Now, a concession:</strong></p>

  <p>I don't go to every women-focused meetup. They're not all for me. But that's just it: if I don't find something useful or beneficial, I simply don't go. It doesn't offend me that they exist and it doesn't offend the organizers that I'm not there. They certainly haven't made my job as a woman in this industry any harder. I attend the meetups and events that I do find useful. I have greatly benefitted from meeting other women who do the same things I do and who run into the same challenges. I've grown an amazing support system from this. It's important to keep in mind that WIT groups and meetups were all started by someone who saw a need for them, and they provide value for people with similar needs and experiences.</p>

  <p>The truth is, we'll always disagree with one another on what is and isn't valuable. And we should. Dissent is, after all, a byproduct of diversity. And it's something we all should encourage and embrace. But I wonder if disagreeing needs to lead to attacking or attempting to discredit communities and support systems because we don't directly benefit from them.</p>

  <p>I see the tech industry growing and changing. I see more women at the conferences I attend, I work with more women on the technical teams I'm a part of, and I'm building and strengthening my relationships with other women in the community all the time. These are all things that I value and that I believe are making tech a better place for myself and for other women to be.</p>

  <p>If you're interested in getting involved with women-focused events or supporting programs that women (of all ages) benefit from, I'm sure any of <a>these awesome organizations</a> could use your help.</p>
