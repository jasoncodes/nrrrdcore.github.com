  <p>I didn't grow up believing I could do anything I wanted to.</p>

  <p>I come from a community where both men and women often don't continue their education past high school and are discouraged from pursuing unconventional careers- especially those that require extended learning. Most of the people I grew up with ended up with jobs paying just above minimum wage and that have very little room for growth or promotion. Most people where I come from do not believe they have the ability to change their circumstances and they very rarely move up in socio-economic class.</p>

  <p>I was frequently discouraged from pursuing a career that required a college education because of the finanical burden and risks it would impose. I knew that I wanted to do something different than what I saw around me. I wanted to go to college, but I didn't think much past that because of how unlikely it seemed that I would make it there and finish my education. I didn't know a single computer scientist. I didn't know that 'web developer' or 'software designer' were careers. Nothing I hadn't seen my parents or my friend's parents do seemed within my reach.</p>

  <p>I stumpled upon my first job at a tech company by total accident. And while all of the developers who worked there encouraged me to learn how to program and design, it wasn't until I saw a woman succeed in that enviroment that I thought it was also possible for me.</p>

  <p>I would consider myself somewhat successful. I am a designer and a developer at a company I love and one that is well-respected by others. The work I do doesn't feel like work. My yearly salary is almost 3x what my mother made when she retired after 35 years of work. And I get to do things very few people who come from where I come from get to do: I get to travel, set my own work schedule, and most importantly, I believe that I have the opportunity to effect change. Sometimes, if I'm really lucky, I get to inspire other people to do the same.</p>

  <p>My experiences thus far have lead me to want to make it easier for people like me to succeed in this industry. So along with designing and building web applications, I've created some things that a younger, less experienced me would have benefited from at the start of my career. These things do not exclude men from participating. Instead, they are aimed at strengthening the community around and surfacing the work of women who are respected by women and men alike.</p>

  <p>Every time I talk about what lead me to create <a href="http://passion-projects.github.com/">Passion Projects</a>, I am forced to talk about my negative experiences in the tech industry. A coworker and friend recently brought it to my attention that if I hadn't experienced those things, I wouldn't be motivated or have the experience to attempt to fix the things that caused me to have those bad experiences in the first place. Whether or not my efforts have had a positive net impact on the community, I can't be entirely sure. But my friend's words made me feel like I' was moving in the right direction.</p>

  <p>The best way to make sure your experience doesn't go to waste is to invest it in other people. I believe most Women in Tech initiatives are reinvesting the collective experience of other women in our industry and building communities and support systems around that shared experience.</p>

  <p>If you've succeeded without support systems like these, that's great. You should be proud of yourself. You have every right to be. Keep doing what you're doing, because it's working for you. It is not, however, up to any of us to decide what will work for other people. Even if those people, like you, identify with the same gender. None of us should attempt to discredit or attack other communities or support systems purely because they are not directly benefiting us. In doing so, we discourage people, specifically marginalized people, from reaching out for the support and resources they may actually want or need.</p>

  <p>Sure there are problems. Some of these were addressed in <a href="http://pensieve.verou.me/post/54853162595/on-women-in-tech">a recent blog post</a> and while I had a hard time agreeing with the author's conclusions about the impact of the Women in Tech movement, I found a few specific arguments to be quite valid:
    <ul>
      <li>I, too, am deeply bothered by the idea that women should be hired into roles they aren't qualified for diversity's sake. It's a problem that I've been vocal about in hiring conversations and this concern has been met with respect and consideration by most. No one wants to be hired to be a token anything. Nor does anyone want to be hired to meet a quota, and if they do, they're probably there for the wrong reasons.</li>
      <br>
      <li>As a woman, and someone from a mixed background, I am also usually offended when people use political, racial, or gender equality issues as a platform to promote themselves or to define their personal brand.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p><strong>Now, a concession:</strong></p>

  <p>I don't go to every women-focused meetup. They're not all for me. But that's just it: if I don't find something useful or beneficial, I simply don't go. It doesn't offend me that they exist and it doesn't offend the organizers that I'm not there. I go to the meetups and events that I do find useful. I have greatly benefited from growing a support system by meeting other women who do the same things I do and who run into the same challenges. These groups and meetups were all started by someone who saw a need for them, and they provide value for people with similar needs and experiences. I don't think them existing has made my job any harder as a woman in this industry.</p>

  <p>We'll always disagree with one another on what is and isn't valuable. And we should. Dissent is, after all, a byproduct of diversity. It's something we all should encourage. But it's not our jobs to attack or attempt to discredit support sytems and communities just because we don't directly benefit from them.</p>

  <p>The tech industry is growing and changing. I see more women at the conferences I attend, I work with more women on the technical teams I'm a part of, and I'm building and strengthening my relationships with other women in the community every day. These are all things that I value and that I believe are making tech a better place for myself and for other women to be.</p>

  <p>If you're interested in getting involved with women-focused events or supporting programs that women (of all ages) benefit from, I'm sure any of <a>these awesome organizations</a> could use your help.</p>
