<p>Julie Ann Horvath is not a robot. She does a lot of: Designing, coding, and writing. And a little less: Traveling, speaking, and obsessing over Great White Sharks. She currently resides in San Francisco and works as a Designer and FrontEnder at GitHub proper.</p>

<p>Wanna chat? I'm currently not accepting <strong>any</strong> freelance projects. But, if you're an open-source developer with a project in need of design love, <a href="mailto:j.ann.horvath@gmail.com">holler</a>.</p>
