<p>I'm a designer and frontend developer at <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. I like to think of myself as an open source advocate with a big heart for making mockups in markup. I spend a lot of my time speaking at conferences and volunteering to teach (more) women to code.</p>

<p>I'm currently not accepting <strong>any</strong> freelance projects. But, if you're an open-source developer with a project in need of design love, <a href="mailto:j.ann.horvath@gmail.com">holler</a>.</p>
